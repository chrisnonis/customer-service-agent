## **What We Did Today**

### 1. **Google Custom Search Grounding**
- Implemented Google Custom Search as a grounding tool for up-to-date sports info.
- Fixed .env variable issues (typo: `CUSTOMER` â†’ `CUSTOM`).
- Added debug prints to confirm environment variable loading.
- Ensured the backend uses the correct API key and CSE ID.
- Improved formatting of search results (clickable links, snippets, all results shown).
- Added placeholder for scraping fixture lists from official sites (chelseafc.com, premierleague.com).

### 2. **Agent Logic and Triage**
- Refactored agent logic to always let Gemini answer first.
- Only use tools/grounding if Gemini doesn't know or says so explicitly.
- Made grounding detection much less aggressive (no more time-sensitive term triggers).
- Updated agent prompts for Premier League, Championship, and Boxing to:
  - Use their knowledge first
  - Only mention real-time limitations if truly needed
  - Use grounding only if Gemini says it doesn't know
- Made the Triage Agent more human-like, conversational, and transparent about handoffs.
- Added debug prints to show agent routing and tool usage.
- Implemented automatic handoff back to triage if a specialist agent can't answer.

### 3. **Testing and Debugging**
- Ran multiple queries to test Gemini's knowledge vs. tool/static answers.
- Fixed issues where static tool answers were overriding Gemini's intelligence.
- Ensured that for queries like "what are Chelsea's next fixtures", Gemini's answer is used unless it truly doesn't know.
- Confirmed that grounding is only triggered when Gemini says it doesn't know.
- Diagnosed and fixed 500 errors (root cause: Gemini API quota exceeded).

### 4. **API Quota Issue**
- Hit the daily free tier quota for Gemini API (429 error).
- Documented that this is not a code bug, but a usage limit from Google.
- Plan to resume work after quota resets or with a paid plan.

## **What Still Needs To Be Done (Tomorrow)**

1. **Resume Testing After Quota Reset**
   - Confirm that Gemini answers are being used for all agents (Premier League, Championship, Boxing).
   - Ensure grounding only triggers when Gemini truly doesn't know.
   - Test Triage Agent's human-like handoff and clarifying questions.

2. **(Optional) Improve Scraping for Fixtures/Results**
   - Implement real scraping logic for chelseafc.com, premierleague.com, Wikipedia, etc.
   - Extract and display actual fixture lists or league tables for queries like "Premier League 2024/25 final table".

3. **(Optional) Further Tune Prompts and Triage**
   - Add more personality or context to agent handoffs.
   - Make Triage Agent even more conversational and context-aware.
   - Add more fallback logic for ambiguous queries.

4. **(Optional) Add More Debugging/Logging**
   - Track which agent/tool/grounding path was used for each query.
   - Log user queries and responses for future analysis.

5. **(Optional) UI Improvements**
   - Make web results more visually distinct in the chat.
   - Show agent handoff messages in a friendly way.

## **How to Resume Tomorrow**

1. Wait for Gemini API quota to reset (or upgrade your plan).
2. Restart the backend and frontend.
3. Use this log to replay and verify all the improvements.
4. Continue with the next steps above.
